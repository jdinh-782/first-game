    cout << "(You): I'm going to go check it out. "; Validity::pressEnterKey();

    cout << "(You): I don't know my name, who I am, or where I even came from! Everything so far has been mind-boggling for me. "; Validity::pressEnterKey();
    cout << "\n(Director): I understand. Our brave men that we lost in that war...what I would do to bring them back to Earth! "; Validity::pressEnterKey();

    cout << "\n(You): Yea I found it on a rock...sounds pretty dull I know. Is it somehow yours? "; Validity::pressEnterKey();
    cout << "\n(Director): Oh no! No way that sword could be mine. It looks like it's only attracted to certain people. "; Validity::pressEnterKey();
    cout << "(Director): Here are our shops where you can buy the proper necessities for your journey! "; Validity::pressEnterKey();
    cout << "(Director): This shop on my left sells potions that will supply you with huge benefits! May come in handy one day. "; Validity::pressEnterKey();
    cout << "(Director): If you look to your right, our spells shop will teach you unique yet powerful magic! "; Validity::pressEnterKey();
    cout << "(Director): A little side note...you may be interested in this minigame! It's offered at this stand over here. "; Validity::pressEnterKey();
    cout << "(Director): That should be all for now. Please make yourself feel at home. Thank you...our savior.. "; Validity::pressEnterKey();
